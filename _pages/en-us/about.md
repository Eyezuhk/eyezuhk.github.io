I've always been curious about how things work, which led me study `Telecommunications Engineering` at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology of Cear√° [IFCE](https://ifce.edu.br/). I gained valuable experience in scientific <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">research</code> within a [photonics laboratory](http://fotonica.fortaleza.ifce.edu.br/?page_id=1603), where I explored the fascinating world of light and its applications.

However, my true passion is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">information security</code>. I've spent most of my career working in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Security Operations</code>, where I've developed strong problem-solving and communication skills. I believe that sharing knowledge is key to achieving common goals. My experience with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIEM</code> has sparked a passion for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Threat Hunting</code>, where I actively seek out hidden threats.

I've had the opportunity to work with organizations from around the world, which has helped me become a skilled multitasker and team player. I'm currently looking to expand my skills in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Malware Analysis</code>.

My goal is to contribute to a safer online world, protecting people and organizations from cyber threats.

I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this dynamic field.
